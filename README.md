# What is this?

This is an all-in-one solution for the following scripts:
- [Stupifier Script provided in Discord](https://discord.com/channels/492590071455940612/1124032073557086258/1126226814629576858)
This is script will sync a directory with a Google Drive folder. 
- [Drazzilb08 User Scripts](https://github.com/Drazzilb08/userScripts)
This script will fix naming of the image based on the naming you have on arr apps.
- [MM2k-BORDER-REPLACER](https://github.com/listentofaze/mm2k-border-replacer/tree/main)
This script will replace or remove the borders of the images.

# How to use it?

The recommended use of the script is to use the docker container provided in the 
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mrzablah/spp) or [GHCR](https://github.com/MrZablah/SyncPosterProcess/pkgs/container/spp)
and configure it as explained below, but you can also use the script directly.

# Docker
There are several ways to run the docker container, but the recommended way is to use the following command:
```bash
docker run -d \
    --name spp \
    -v /path/to/config:/config \
    -v /path/to/data:/data \
    -e TZ=America/Monterrey \
    -e PUID=100 \
    -e PGID=99 \
    -e UMASK=000 \
    mrzablah/spp:latest
```
Keep in mind that you need to change the TZ variable to your timezone, so you can se the schedule correctly,
and the volumes to the path you want to use.

## Parameters

Container images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above).

|         Parameter         | Function                                                                                                       |
|:-------------------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|      `-e PUID=1000`       | for UserID - see below for explanation                                                                         |
|       `-e PGID=99`        | for GroupID - see below for explanation                                                                        |
| `-e TZ=America/Monterrey` | specify a timezone to use, see this [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List). |
|       `-v /config`        | where the config.yml file will be                                                                              |
|        `-v /data`         | Paths to saved the images. You can add as many as you need e.g. `/raw_posters`, `/renamer`, etc.               |

# Configuration file
The config file is where you will change all the settings for any of the scripts.

## Global
The first part to change is the global section:
```yaml
global:
  run_now: true # If true it will run the script immediately, if false it will wait until the schedule_hour
  schedule_hour: 4 # This is the hour of the day you want the script to run, it's based on a 24-hour clock and defaults to 4am
  log_level: info # log_level can be: debug, info, warning, error, critical
  radarr:
    # name is the name of the radarr instance, this is used to reference the instance in other scripts
    - name: radarr_1
      # api is the api key for the radarr instance
      api: abcdefghijlmnop
      # url is the url for the radarr instance
      url: http://localhost:7878
    - name: radarr_2
      api: abcdefghijklmnop
      url: http://localhost:1212
  sonarr:
    # name is the name of the sonarr instance, this is used to reference the instance in other scripts
    - name: sonarr_1
      # api is the api key for the sonarr instance
      api: abcdefghijlmnop
      # url is the url for the sonarr instance
      url: http://localhost:8989
    # name is the name of the second sonarr instance, this is used to reference the instance in other scripts, names must match
    - name: sonarr_2
      api: abcdefghijlmnop
      url: http://localhost:9090
  plex:
    # name is the name of the plex instance, this is used to reference the instance in other scripts
    - name: plex
      # api is the token key for the plex instance, if you don't know your token, please see https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/
      api: abcdefghijlmnop
      # url is the url for the plex instance
      url: http://localhost:32400
```

## Discord and Notifiarr
This is the section for discord and notifiarr. If you don't use any of them, you can leave this blank.
```yaml
discord:
  # This is the webhook for Notifiarr. if you don't use Notifiarr, you can leave this blank
  notifiarr_webhook:
  # These are the webhooks for the discord scripts. if you don't use discord, you can leave these blanks
  renamer:
    # This is the discord webhook for this script
    discord_webhook:
    # This is the channel id for the discord script. Channel id is only needed if using Notifiarr
    channel_id:
  unmatched-assets:
    discord_webhook:
    channel_id:
```

## Sync Google Drive
There are sections for each of scripts,
you can enable or disable any of the script with the `run` variable.

1. Get RClone client ID and Secret following these [instructions](https://rclone.org/drive/#making-your-own-client-id)
2. Then get a token following these [instructions](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/)

> Alternatively, use Google Cloud Service Account instead of token:
- Creating and using this option will make it, so you don't need to create the token manually, but I will still strongly
  recommend to still add the Client ID and Client Secret and just change the token to SA, otherwise you might reach some limits.

> Instructions for creating a Google Cloud Service Account
1. To create a service account and obtain its credentials, go to the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
2. You must have a projectâ€”create one if you don't.
3. Then go to "IAM & admin" -> "Service Accounts."
4. Use the "Create Service Account" button. Fill in "Service account name" and "Service account ID" with something that identifies your client.
5. Select "Create And Continue." Step 2 and 3 are optional.
6. Once created, you will need to go to the Actions of the SA -> Manage Keys and create a JSON key and save it as a file.
7. These credentials are what rclone will use for authentication. If you ever need to remove access, press the "Delete service account key" button.

> As a fallback, you can use sync_location and gdrive_id, but this is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
```yaml
sync_gdrive:
  run: true # If false, it will skip this step
  client_id: asdasds.apps.googleusercontent.com # Client ID for rclone usually ends with .apps.googleusercontent.com
  client_secret: GOCSPX-asda123 # Client Secret for rclone, usually starts with GOCSPX-
  token: # The token for rclone, this is the output of rclone config dump that needs to run manually
  # Token looks like this: { "access_token": "value", "token_type": "Bearer", "refresh_token": "value", "expiry": "value" }
  gdrive_sa_location: /config/rclone_sa.json # The location of your rclone service account file (JSON)
  # we have deprecated gdrive_id and sync_location so please use this instead
  gdrive_sync: # example of multiple gdrive_id's with multiple sync_locations as objects
    - id: 1VeeQ_frBFpp6AZLimaJSSr0Qsrl6Tb7z # The ID of the folder you want to sync from
      location: /data/input # Where you want to sync the posters to
    - id: 1wrSru-46iIN1iqCl2Cjhj5ofdazPgbsz # The ID of the folder you want to sync from
      location: /data/input2 # Where you want to sync the posters to
```

## Renamer
```yaml
renamer:
  run: true # If false, it will skip this step
  # Options are 'true' or 'false'
  dry_run: true # dry_run can be true or false, if true, it will not rename anything
  asset_folders: false
  # Options are 'copy' or 'move'
  action_type: copy
  print_only_renames: false # If print_only_renames is True, then we don't want to print files that don't need to be renamed
  # Library names are used to match collection posters to the collections listed w/in Plex.
  # Typically, Movie Libraries are used
  library_names:
    - Movies
    - TV Shows
    - Anime Movies
  # Where your ingest movies folder is (THe source and destination should not be the same directory)
  source_dir: /path/to/posters/ <--- Lowest priority
  # What posters you'd like to override the souce dir with. This dir will take priority for assets over source_dir
  # To not use any override, simply leave it blank or remove it from the config
  # Can be a single dir or a list of dirs
  source_overrides:
    - /path/to/posters/override/ <--- Middle priority
    - /path/to/posters/override2/ <--- Highest priority
  # Where your posters are going to go. In my usecase I use Plex-Meta-Manager. This is the /config/assets dir for PMM for me.
  destination_dir: /path/to/poster/destination
  # The thresholds are used to consider what is a "Match"
  # As with any automation, there is never a 100% guarantee of accuracy.
  # There will be timed the script will mess up.
  # If, however, you see it messing up more often on things, you can restrict the threshold.
  # 0 = Anything goes, 100 = Must be exact match
  # The default numbers here are based upon what I've seen to be the most effective, I've had one-offs where I had to manually fix things.
  collection_threshold: 99
  # Decide which radarr instance you will be using for renamer, this is useful if you have,
  # for example, A Sonarr/Sonarr-Anime and/or Radarr/Radarr-Anime
  # If you however duplicate entries between a Radarr/Radarr4K, for example.
  # This won't help and will only double the work for the script for no gain.
  radarr:
    - name: radarr_1
  sonarr:
    - name: sonarr_1
    - name: sonarr_2
```

## Border Replacer
```yaml
fix_border:
  run: true # If false, it will skip this step
  input_folder: /data/input # Where your posters are going to be coming from
  output_folder: /data/fix_posters # Where your posters are going to go
  border_color: none # This will remove the border of the image, but you can also add a color to change the border to any hex color, Ej: '#000000'
  overwrite_existing: true # If true, it will overwrite the existing poster, if false it will skip the poster
  resize: false # If true, it will resize the poster to 1000x1500; this requires border_color to be set to a 'none'
  bottom_only: false # If true, it will only keep the bottom border; this requires border_color to be set to a color Ej: '#000000'
```
